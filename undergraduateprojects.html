                <p>ISOLATION AND MOLECULAR DETECTION OF <i>KLEBSIELLA</i> SPECIES FROM WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT  </p>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Clean, safe and adequate freshwater is vital to the survival of all living organisms and the 
                    smooth functioning of ecosystems, communities and economies declining water quality 
                    has become a global issue of concern, most of the pathogens are distributed to water 
                    body, agricultural products and foods through sewage and ineffective-treated public 
                    wastewater. Municipal wastewater treatment facilities are considered to be “hotspots” for 
                    antibiotic resistance. In this study, <i>Klebsiella</i> occurrence in hospital effluent was 
                    assessed. The identities of the presumptive <i>Klebsiella</i> species was confirmed through 
                    conventional PCR method with 26% (6/23) of the presumptive isolates positive. 
                    This finding reveals that the effluents from the hospital could harbor potentially 
                    pathogenic <i>Klebsiella</i> species which could be transmitted to humans through direct 
                    interaction or indirect means. Proper effluent treatment techniques should be employed 
                    before discharge of effluents into the environment.</p>

                <p>ISOLATION AND MOLECULAR DETECTION OF <i>Escherichia coli<i/> FROM IRRIGATION WATER SOURCES IN ILE-IFE AND MODAKEKE COMMUNITIES.</p>
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>In the absence of rain, a natural source of water supply for farming, water is gotten from sources such as rivers and springs through different mechanisms such as pipes or drizzles called irrigation. In this study, the microbial assessment of irrigation water sources from six sampling points was done. Upon the growth and isolation of the presumptive organisms from the samples collected, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the identities of the presumptive <i>Escherichia coli<i/> isolates. Out of the 16 isolates, all 16 were positive. Generally, the result from this study indicates that the quality of water for irrigation in both Ile-Ife and Modakeke community is low and has become a hotspot for the discharge of <i>Escherichia coli<i/> when used making the agricultural product unsuitable for consumption which further signifies the importance of treating the sources of irrigation before it is being used.</p>
